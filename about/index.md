<center>I'm Aditi Gupta. I am a software engineer by day. Apart from programming, I like board games, traveling and capturing my adventures.</center>

## Developer Story
* I work as a software engineer at [<i class="fab fa-atlassian"></i>](https://www.atlassian.com) where I'm a part of the Marketplace team.
* I also spent a few years as a part of the engineering team at [Walmart Labs](https://www.walmartlabs.com).
* As a postgrad, I got to work in the field of computational chemistry trying to understand the properties of certain nanoparticles.
* I was fortunate enough to graduate from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in) with a bachelor's in Computer Science and a master's degree in Computational Natural Science.

## Interests
* I enjoy reading, you can [follow me on goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15163026-aditi).
* I also indulge in board games from time to time.
* Few of my favourite musicians include God is an Astronaut, Queen, Snow Patrol and Parvaaz.
* I've always loved traveling, and that is how I developed an interest in photography.
